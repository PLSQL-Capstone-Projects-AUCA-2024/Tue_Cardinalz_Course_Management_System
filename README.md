## PHASE 2: 💼Business Process Modeling focuses on defining and visualizing the workflow of the course management system. This phase includes:
<br>

⚡ _**Scope**_ : Centralizing course management tasks like attendance, assignments, and grading.

😊 _**Objectives**_ : Automate attendance tracking, simplify grading, and offer real-time performance data.

😈 _**Entities**_ : Lecturer, Course, Class, Student, Assignment, Grade, and Department, each playing a specific role in the workflow.

😎 _**Significance in MIS**_ : The system supports decision-making by giving lecturers insights into student performance, enhancing efficiency in course administration​(refernce to Phase 2.docx ).

Together, these documents lay the foundation for a course management system that supports lecturers in administrative tasks and contributes to better educational outcomes.

# PHASE 4: 📡 _CREATING DATABASE AND ORACLE ENTERPRISE MANAGER._

## CREATION OF A PLUGGABLE DATABASE:
 We have to create a pluggable database for our project and we name it " _**TUE_CARDINALS_COURSEMANAGEMENTSYSTEM**_ ". We created it using the following codes
